### Hardware


1. Bread-And-Brenden
	- Currently working on learning front-end development to 
create the UI for the site. The entire API and backend work, however, I
need to implement the front-end for the site for user interaction.
	- Update: Completed the backend and the API some point at the beginning of Fall 2021 semester. Front-end is fine for now but I have been trouble getting the site deployed. If this get's done the site will basically be done.

2. NetworkGrapher
	- Goals: implement scrolling in an out, group nodes that are linked close to eachother and nodes that arent linked further out, color nodes in the same group.
	- Currently, not working locally. 
	- I want to use this for visualizing wikipedia data that I scraped.

3. UCF-Schedule-Tool
	- Original idea of tool working as intended. 
	- Goal: implement textbook (pdf) retrieval from user input ISBNs.
	- Update: Implemented the goal above, and it worked fine. However, Libgen has changed their UI such that the scraping is not working anymore. Might implement this in selenium.

4. Crawler
	- Need to figure out the main goal for this project
	- Idea is to have a fast web scraper developed in C that can do some
basic web-crawling.
	- Update: Not sure if I'll ever get to this.

5. Meanness Detector Bot
	- Need to implement createIndex() in Storage.py to ensure no duplicates are added to the database.
	- Update: This was fixed. Bot is working well. 

6. Wikipedia Network Analysis
	- Would like to have databases automatically created. I started doing this on my desktop computer with Selenium but I stopped at somepoint.i
	- Update: Not sure when I'll get back to this.
